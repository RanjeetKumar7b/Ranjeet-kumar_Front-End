Question 1. Explain what the simple List component does.

solution:-
A user interface (UI) component called Simple List shows a list of things in either a vertical or horizontal manner. 
It is a frequently utilised user interface element in a lot of web and mobile applications.
The Simple List component can be customised to incorporate additional elements like photos, checkboxes,
or buttons in addition to the text or icons that are typically displayed for each item. 
The list can be static or dynamic, which means that it can be filled with information from a user input or a database.
Additionally, the Simple List component may be used with other UI elements to build more intricate user interfaces,
including drop-down menus or navigation bars.
Many developers and designers favour it because of its simplicity and adaptability.
