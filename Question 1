Question 1. Explain what the simple List component does.

The List component consists of List Items that are wrapped in a component called WrappedSingleListItem.
Each ListItem has a state called isSelected and values for text and index, as well as an event called onClickHandler. 
These components are memoized using memo(WrappedListComponent), which means that if the same arguments are passed, the result will be returned from memory.
The List component uses the map() method to iterate over an array of data and calls a function for each element.
The resulting List Items are stored in an array called items. The background color of the text gets changed based on the state of isSelected. 
If the state is true, the text will be displayed in green else it will be displayed in red.
